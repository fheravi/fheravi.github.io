I am currently a software engineer at Vanguard. I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) in the Learning Agents Research Group. My research was in Reinforcement Learning applications in Robotic Manipulation, particularly exploring curriculum learning and planning. I have general interests in reinforcement learning and quantum computing.
