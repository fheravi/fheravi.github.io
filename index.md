I am currently a software engineer at [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal). I recently graduated from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) in the [Learning Agents Research Group](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/research.shtml). My research was in reinforcement learning applications in robotic manipulation, particularly exploring curriculum learning and planning. I have general interests in reinforcement learning and quantum computing.
